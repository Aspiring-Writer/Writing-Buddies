Dear Diary, do you want to know a secret? Of course, you do, that’s what diaries are for. You tell them all your secrets and hide it so no one will find it. Yeah, well, someone always does.

So, back to my question, do you want to know my biggest secret ever? That’s too bad, ‘cause I can’t tell you, I can’t tell anyone. I’ve almost told my best friends several times, but I couldn’t. My biggest secret is so bad that it could destroy everything --- my life, my family, and my friends. That’s why I can’t tell anyone. Too bad Jennifer had other plans. Who’s Jennifer? Oh, let me tell you about her, let me tell you everything about the little witch named Jennifer…

Jennifer Stone was the new girl who decided to become the queen of the school and make my life miserable on the same day. I don’t know why I became her target but I quickly realized what a special honor I’d been given. Jennifer was super nice to everyone, that really popular girl who everybody, including the teachers, liked. Oh, wait, maybe that's why she immediately hated me. I guess there can only be one most-favored girl in school. Honestly, though, I was here first. She keeps doing little things to agitate me, like spilling stuff on my books ("accidentally" of course), messing with my locker, stealing my notes, making up weird things about me, you get the idea. So, you see why she's a witch? Seriously, if someone talks, walks, and dresses like a witch wouldn't you call them a witch? I'm serious. she actually acts like a witch! Even her fingernails say witch. I once called her a witch to her face and she just curtsied, smiled, and thanked me for the "compliment." I swear she's copying my playbook because that's one of my favorite tactics. Not that I'm mean to anyone, I only do that to people who are trying to insult me for random reasons. But enough about Jennifer, let's talk about her half-brother Caden.
