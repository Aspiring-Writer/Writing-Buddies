  bio:
    I'm an eighteen-year-old, homeschooled, Christian student who is struggling to stay motivated and finish things.
    I love Jesus, pretty much any yarn crafts (crochet, knitting, macrame, been there done that), reading, writing, horses,
    developing websites (new at that), FOSS, and anything Linux
    (I'm not a complete tech geek but I definitely see myself getting there blush).
    <br><br>
    I'm very social, which isn't a very good thing since I trust people too easily wink, but I'm getting better.
    I open my mouth a lot before thinking, but as I said, I'm getting better.
    I procrastinate way too much but prayerfully I will learn some self-control and apply it everywhere in my life
    (starting with my mouthðŸ˜‹).

    Hello! I'm a Capricorn Monkey, INFP-A, and an Enneagram Type Four.
    <br><br>
    I call myself a recovering workaholic, now advocating for self-love.
    Self-betterment is a goal I try to pursue every day.
    My life principles may be mostly ascribed to Buddhism, though I can't say for certain that I'm a practitioner.
    I've been mostly vegetarian since the last week of October 2018, around the same time I signed up in Habitica.
    <br><br>
    I'm passionate about journalism and, more recently, rediscovered my fascination with classical music.
    An old soul who still prefers writing with pen and paper,
