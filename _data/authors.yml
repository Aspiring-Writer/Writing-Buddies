  bio:
    I'm an eighteen-year-old, homeschooled, Christian student who is struggling to stay motivated and finish things.

    I love Jesus, pretty much any yarn crafts (crochet, knitting, macrame, been there done that), reading, writing, horses,
    developing websites (new at that), FOSS, and anything Linux
    (I'm not a complete tech geek but I definitely see myself getting there blush).

    I'm very social, which isn't a very good thing since I trust people too easily wink, but I'm getting better.
    I open my mouth a lot before thinking, but as I said, I'm getting better.
    I procrastinate way too much but prayerfully I will learn some self-control and apply it everywhere in my life
    (starting with my mouthðŸ˜‹).

    PM me if you need help, prayers, encouragement, or just a friend.

    I am the guild leader of [Writing Buddies](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/0b3b0faf-41f0-48e7-8e0f-5e2793658041)
    on the awesome RPG-style to-do list app [Habitica](https://habitica.com).
    My guild is all about finding someone(s) to help you write that awesome story or blog you've been thinking about.
    Check it out!

    Did I mention I love to read! Do you want to know what I'm currently reading?

  bio:
    Hello! I'm a Capricorn Monkey, INFP-A, and an Enneagram Type Four.

    I call myself a recovering workaholic, now advocating for self-love.
    Self-betterment is a goal I try to pursue every day.
    My life principles may be mostly ascribed to Buddhism, though I can't say for certain that I'm a practitioner.
    I've been mostly vegetarian since the last week of October 2018, around the same time I signed up in Habitica.

    I'm passionate about journalism and, more recently, rediscovered my fascination with classical music.
    An old soul who still prefers writing with pen and paper,
    I keep an online personal journal at www.cherishmysong.com :)
