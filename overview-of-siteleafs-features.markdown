Siteleaf is an awesome CMS that is very easy to use. Most of it is pretty self-explanatory and even your grandparents could probably figure it out. But, just in case you're like me and you like to have the instructions, here's an overview of what you will find once you log into Siteleaf for this site.

## Collections
Once you log into Siteleaf, you should immediately be redirected to the "Pages" collection (more on that below). If you look at the far left of the screen you should see a section that is titled "Content"

These are all the collections in the site, there are currently only 5:
- Pages
- Authors
- Books
- Posts
- Series

You will need to get familiar with what each of these collections contains in order to put the right content in the right place.

Whenever you click on one of these collections, you will be presented with an editor containing a title, content box, tags, categories, date, and any other metadata that goes with that collection. Most of these (like the tags, categories, and date fields) are pretty simple, and I won't go over them too much.

**Warning:** DO NOT include the quotation marks for any of the fields, those are just there to emphasize the field names and what you should enter in.

## Pages
The first page you should land on once you log in is the "Pages" collection. These are just, you know, pages. Chances are you won't be using this collection much.

## Authors
This is the collection containing all the authors on this site. If you post something, anything, you will need to create an author page for yourself. When you click "New author," 
1. Put your name in the title (or your pen name),
2. Write a bio (it can be as long, or short, as you want) in the content box,
3. Upload a picture for your avatar in the "image" box, and 
4. Write a short bio that will appear with your avatar under the posts you write in the "excerpt" field.

That's easy-peasy, right?

## Books
This collection holds all the index pages for the books we're writing. An index page is basically the book's description and the list of chapters, or posts, that go with that book.

When you click on "New book", you will need to:
1. Write the title of your book in the "title" box,
2. Write your book's description in the "content" box,
3. Click the dropdown box in the "author" field and select your name,
4. Upload, or choose, an image for your book's cover (this image should be used as the teaser-image in your following posts, more on that later).

**Note:** If the book is also part of a series of books and you want to include that, add a metadata field called "series" and select the series' name in the dropdown box (more on that below).

## Posts
This is the collection that you will be using the most, it is where all the posts are kept. Simple, right? All the articles, book chapters, short stories, poetry, plays, etc. are kept in this one collection.

This is the one collection where you don't have to fill out all the metadata, some of those fields will be left blank depending on the type of post you are writing and they're just there for convenience. You can just delete the fields you don't use. However, you must fill out the "author", "tags", and "categories" fields.

We already went over what to do with the "author" field, for the "tags" and "categories" field you just put in things to help label your post.

### Tags
Tags can be anything, but I recommend you keep them simple and to the point. For books, they are used as genres as well as any other label you want to associate with the post.

### Categories
This field is **important!** Whatever you put in this field will be reflected in the URL for the post. You should **ONLY** put the type of post and the book/series it is associated with. They should be plural.

- For books: "books" and "your-book-name"
- For posts that are part of a series: "series" and "your-series-name"
- For poetry: "poetry"
- For plays: "plays"
- For articles: "articles"

## Series
This is just like the "Books" collection, it holds the index pages for the site's series. This is mainly for blog posts that are part of a series but can also be used for books that are part of a series. If you are also using it for books that are part of a series, make sure you add a "series" metadata field to that book's index page in the "Books" collection.
