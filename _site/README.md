# Welcome to Writing Buddies!

This site is a communal blog for me and some writing buddies from the Writing Buddies guild on [Habitica](https://habitica.com).

On this site, we post stuff we write, whether that's blog posts, poems, short stories, or full books. Anything and everything is accepted.

## Adding Your Own Posts

Since this is a communal blog for writers of all ages, it would make sense that I told you how to add your own content, right? Well, check out [the wiki!](https://github.com/Aspiring-Writer/aspiring-writer.github.io/wiki) In the wiki pages, I show you how to add your own works-in-progress to our site and join our community! Pretty excited, right? You don't need to know how to use GitHub or how to code, just follow along and I'll show you what you need to do.
