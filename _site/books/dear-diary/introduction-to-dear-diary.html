    <meta name="description" content="Dear Diary, Do You Wanna Hear A Secret? started as a funny scene I created in my head. The scene was the one with the truth-or-dare part. I really liked it and decided to write it down. So, at midnight on May 28, 2020, The Dear Diary, Do You Wanna Hear A Secret? project was started. It was an absolute joy to write. The words just flowed out of my head and into paper. I have never written chapters so fast. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>All Sasha wanted to do was finish school, get a job she loved, get married, and start a family. Unfortunately, getting past school seems impossible. Between staying on track with her studies and keeping up with her other activities, graduation couldnâ€™t be farther away. But then the Stoneâ€™s show up.</p>

<p>Caden Stone isâ€¦ hot. Thatâ€™s the only way Sasha can describe him without sounding like an idiot. Heâ€™s just the guy she should avoid. Which isnâ€™t that hard, even though he watchs her every day and makes her skin crawl. Yeah, avoiding Caden would be a great idea if she wanted to keep her virginity. Too bad Jennifer, Cadenâ€™s half-sister, has other plans.</p>

<p>Do you wanna know a secret? Because Iâ€™ve got a big one and it just may get me in a whole lot of trouble. If it doesnâ€™t kill me first.</p>

	<p class="author-bio">I'm an eighteen-year-old, homeschooled, Christian student who is struggling to stay motivated and finish things. I love Jesus, pretty much any yarn crafts (crochet, knitting, macrame, been there done that), reading, writing, horses, developing websites (new at that), FOSS, and anything Linux (I'm not a complete tech geek but I definitely see myself getting there blush). <br><br> I'm very social, which isn't a very good thing since I trust people too easily wink, but I'm getting better. I open my mouth a lot before thinking, but as I said, I'm getting better. I procrastinate way too much but prayerfully I will learn some self-control and apply it everywhere in my life (starting with my mouthðŸ˜‹).</p>
