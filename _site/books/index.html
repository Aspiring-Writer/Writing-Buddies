    <p>All Sasha wanted to do was finish school, get a job she loved, get married, and start a family. Unfortunately, getting past school seems impossible. Between staying on track with her studies and keeping up with her other activities, graduation couldn't be farther away. But then the Stone's show up. Caden Stone is... hot. That's the only way Sasha can describe him without sounding like an idiot. He's just the guy she should avoid, one that likes trouble. Avoiding him isn't that hard, even though he watchs her every day and makes her skin crawl. Yeah, avoiding Caden would be a great idea if she wanted to keep her virginity. Too bad Jennifer, Caden's half-sister, has other plans. <br><br> Do you wanna know a secret? Because I've got a big one and it just may get me in a whole lot of trouble. If it doesn't kill me first.</p>

    <h3 id="kidnapped-and-afraid">Kidnapped and Afraid</h3>
    <p>Marissa gets kidnapped by a stranger who seems to enjoy feeding off of her fear. He won’t let her go but allows her to escape just so he can drag her back again. At first, she thinks he’s a psychopath but then he starts doing things that seem impossible. Can he really read her mind? How does his eye color change so fast? Is he manipulating her emotions? Why doesn’t he seem to sleep? Why does he keep her imprisoned? Nothing makes sense and the more she digs the more confusing it gets. He’s not a vampire, he’s not affected by blood, has no problem stalking her during the daylight, and lacks the fangs. He isn’t fae, no pointy ears. He can’t possibly be a werewolf, full moons have come and gone with no change. So, what is he? Who is he? And how will she finally escape him? Will she ever escape him?</p>

    <p>(Her)
<br>
He killed my parents, not to mention dozens of other people.
He's only known by the Phantom but I will uncover his identity and make him pay.
I'm good at this game and I'll play it till I die.
The Phantom thinks he's good, but he hasn't met me yet.
I play with fire, live in it really. That's why I'm called the Phoenix Fox.
The fire may burn me, but I will extinguish it before it can kill me.
<br><br>

(Him)
<br>
Yes, I'm a killer and I'm good at it.
Hundreds have tried to find me, none have succeeded and that's the way I like it.
I wasn't named “The Phantom'' for nothing.
Those who have gotten close I've gotten rid of, all except the cunning little spy known as
the Phoenix Fox. She was at my brother's party and now she's in my head.
I should kill her, I really should. She's gotten too close and she knows it.
She keeps toying with me, jumping in and out of the crossfire.
She's good at the game, but I'm better. The clock is ticking and I'm good at waiting.
I know she'll come to me, they always do. And when she does, I'll take care of her too.
Here little fox, come test my fire.
