  <li>
    <p>Characters in their natural habitat</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The disturbance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Call to adventure (the character can be passive here if needed or actively answer the call)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Character states the plan and starts to move the plot rather than follow someone else’s plan (To pursue their love interest, to not fall in love, to get a job, whatever it might be. This isn’t going to be the final goal.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complications arise and the plan starts to fail.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The promise of the premise (for romance it can be a series of dates.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Midpoint (No turning back. The character realizes he/she is in love. The affair is discovered. Whatever it is, the character can’t go back to the status quo.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New plan(the character has to keep moving the plot instead of being led.) New characters can be introduced as a part of this new plan, but shouldn’t be introduced after this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bad guys close in/self-sabotage/things get complicated</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ticking clock. High stakes. (for example, rushing to the airport after the LI)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Black moment (LI already flew away)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Storming the castle/the final fight to achieve the goal. (characters bring the ending rather than the ending passively happening to them.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Closing image to mirror the opening image. The characters in their new norm.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
