&lt;p&gt;The reader (written in first-person POV) marries Brett in a simple but heartfelt beach wedding attended by friends and family. 
The night of the wedding is muddled by a past experience that goes ashore, but Brett proves he is the best husband there could possibly be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; This story includes a panic attack related to trauma from rape. Discretion is advised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is grounded on the female character’s history of rape and panic attack. While there is no graphic portrayal of the abuse, 
the trauma may still be triggering to some. Please stop reading if you find yourself being affected by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(See the end of the work for more notes.) &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the night of our wedding. We held the ceremonies at our favorite beach, one I consider my “happy place”. 
It won’t be the first thing you’ll say about him but Brett enjoys being by the sea because he likes to swim. We invited our friends and family. 
Of course, Eddy was there as his best man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of a wedding vow, Brett and his friends surprised me with a string quartet performance of an original piece written by Jordon specifically for the occasion. 
I couldn’t hold back my tears as they played for me. It was really sweet, and I made sure to thank every one of them for making our union extra special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t believe I’m finally free to share the bed with Brett tonight. Though his family moved to Australia many years ago and he grew up in a liberated culture, 
Brett’s parents are still a bit conservative, so we were always careful not to disappoint them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brett and I had agreed even before the wedding that our honeymoon will have to be postponed. It only made sense. 
Brett, I, and all our guests are together in this private island. We don’t want to risk making a scandal with those closest and dearest to us as witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I feel so spent from all the wedding preparations and the day’s activities, I’m still unable to sleep. Brett is on the right side of the bed, looking so peaceful. 
The moonlight seeping through our room’s window illuminates a portion of his baby face. 
His pink lips are puckered a bit, unintentionally enticing me to touch them with my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love Brett. I love seeing him like this. So free and calm, as if all his worries have dissipated into thin air. 
I want to touch him, embrace him, make him feel my love. I never thought I could feel this much passion and care for another person; it’s overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I suddenly can’t bring myself to move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lying on my back, staring blankly at the ceiling, I seem to have lost control of my limbs. There’s fear clouding the bliss I am feeling for being with my husband. 
Husband, how I longed to call him that. I wish I can whisper, “Brett, help,” but I don’t have the heart to disturb his serene slumber. 
Tears are welling in my eyes. “Brett, please wake up. I need you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stirs; I reckon he may have sensed my call. Turning to me, he whispers into my ears, “I still can’t believe you’re now my wife.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He touches the side of my face with his beautiful hand, then he feels the wetness around my eye. He pushes himself up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey, love. What’s happening? Are you alright?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take a deep breath and say, “Viola.” My voice cracked. I’m sure he noticed how it took all the strength in me to utter a single, sacrilegious word. 
It’s the secret code we use for whenever my trauma is triggered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brett is aware of my history of rape before we were even a couple. Even as a friend then, he always looked after me with utmost care and respect. 
He takes notice of the little things I do that show my stress — from the seemingly trivial manner of picking the sides of my fingers 
to the more concerning way by which I fall into sudden silence. If he is even bothered by my past, he doesn’t show it. H
e accepts me for everything that I am — and I am truly, deeply grateful that I have him in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay,” he tries to contain his worry. I can’t help but think no timing could possibly be worse than this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He holds my hand. “Let’s take deep breaths together, okay?” he tells me in his deep, bedroom voice. “Inhale. Exhale. Good, let’s do it again. Breathe in… and out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brett brings his other hand on my forehead, running his delicate fingers through my hair. 
“Today’s the day of our wedding. We’re in this beautiful private island that we both love. I’m Brett. I’m your husband. You’re with me. I’m here with you. 
You’re safe now, my love. You’re safe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He knows that when I get panic attacks like this, grounding helps me best. My triggers don’t often affect me, 
but when they do, it’s just impossible for me to make it out of the episode on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My eyes burst into tears, but I am not making any sound. I still can’t move my arms and legs. I’m running out of breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the worst feeling: my body re-lives the moment of the abuse. I don’t even imagine it, but my body reacts as if I were being raped again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brett plants a slow, gentle kiss on my forehead. He doesn’t let go of my hand. 
Throughout my ordeal, he keeps repeating the words, “You’re safe. I’m here. Everything’s fine now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t be sure how long it took until my breathing became deeper and calmer. Brett flashes a faint smile and wraps me in his arms. 
This is just one of the many instances when Brett has saved me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can feel the warmth of his breath on the space between my neck and shoulder. Then, gradually, he moves to face me, and I see genuine concern and love in his eyes. 
I close my eyes and let his soft lips find their way to mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I love you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I love you, too.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first night of our ever after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes-1&quot;&gt;Notes:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello! This is my first attempt at writing a one-shot, so I am still trying to learn the ropes in fan-fiction writing. 
I will greatly appreciate it if you can give me feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In writing this, I drew inspiration from my personal experience with trauma triggers and PTSD, as well as how my boyfriend handles my situation pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important:&lt;/strong&gt; If you experienced or are experiencing sexual abuse and harassment, please seek help. 
It is a painful experience, one I won’t even wish on my enemy, but know that there is hope for recovery. I am a living proof that things will get better. 
It will take a long time to realize it or even acknowledge it yourself, but you matter. 
Your feelings are valid, and you are not to blame — whoever may tell you otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>cherrythecheery</name></author><category term="Fiction" /><category term="Short Story" /><category term="Romance" /><category term="Mental Health Issues" /><category term="PTSD" /><summary type="html">Summary: The reader (written in first-person POV) marries Brett in a simple but heartfelt beach wedding attended by friends and family.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But do musicians ever stop being musicians when they aren’t playing? Isn’t the mere act of living — an accumulation of experiences — part of practicing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brett catches himself overthinking again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he keeps his 1952 Scrollavezza violin into its black case, he overhears one percussionist talking to a couple of wind players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“She’s cute.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nah, bro. She’s out of your league.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’d take my chance anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So you’re asking her out?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If today were like any other day, Brett would’ve approached his colleagues to spend the rest of the afternoon with them.
The bespectacled guy, who’s turning 33 in a few weeks, just loves talking. Uplifting everyone’s moods is as natural to him as breathing.
He’s a high-pitched laugh track occupying 170 centimeters of horizontal space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But today is no ordinary day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brett takes his phone out of his pocket to message his best friend, Eddy.
The duo — more known for their YouTube moniker TwoSet Violin — have known each other for about a third of their lives now
and somehow they still aren’t tired of each other’s company. Such friendship is a rare treasure. Many envy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“DUDE!!!!!!!” Brett couldn’t have sent a more enthusiastic text message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to imagine seeing her again. &lt;em&gt;Has she been in Australia all along? Since when? For how long?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During rehearsals, since he saw her walk into the room, the violinist tried so hard to avoid eye contact.
If he looked at her, even for a split-second, and their eyes met, he was certain he wouldn’t have been able to focus on his music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brett bids his usual jolly goodbye to his friends then hurriedly leaves, making it appear as if he were rushing to make it to another engagement.
That way, no one asks. It’s a blip in an orchestral musician’s routine, yes, but it’s still somehow usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“C’mon, Eddy. Why aren’t you replying!” Brett paces down the stairs as his thoughts race. Every five steps or so, he looks at his phone.
Having learned his lesson from a booboo many years ago, back when he was a rookie musician whose phone rang in the middle of a piano part in rehearsals,
Brett has kept his gadgets on permanent silent mode. But this time, he worries he’d miss Eddy’s text, or call, or reply — &lt;em&gt;whatever it is,
please, Eddy, make this phone churn a notification.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the two violinists met Aimee five years ago, Eddy pondered on making her an addition to the video channel they formed in 2014 as stressed-out conservatory students,
which has eventually grown into a community of millions of musicians and classical music fans (called Ling Ling wannabes) all over the world.
Aimee, with her background in television work, would’ve been an invaluable consultant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than Aimee’s professional insights, however, Eddy valued the new friendship and company.
Not only is she easy to get along with, but Aimee also blends effortlessly with the both of them. The same passion for music.
The inspiring belief that there’s a bigger purpose in life. The dry humor, though she’s often at the receiving end of the guys’ jokes.
The nuggets of wisdom that helped motivate them to strive to be better than they were yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eddy liked her — but five years ago, when she came into their lives, Aimee was on a holiday for only eight days.
The only thing they could do was make the most out of their time with her. Distance is an enemy Eddy wasn’t brave enough to face. Is he any braver now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brett can’t help but smile. Having known Eddy since high school, he knows his best friend will be elated by the news, and the suspense is killing him!
Although they rarely spoke about Aimee throughout these years, Brett never really forgot about her and he’s sure his younger friend is the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only five steps away from the exit gate, Brett stops his stirring and looks behind him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heading toward him is the same woman occupying his thoughts, still wearing the crisp blazer that singles her out in the sea of summer students.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>cherrythecheery</name></author><summary type="html">Brett harks back to his memory from five years ago of Aimee, whom Eddy wanted to be part of TwoSet Violin.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My Editing Process</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/nonfiction/My-Editing-Process" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My Editing Process" /><published>2020-06-26T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-06-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/nonfiction/My-Editing-Process</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/nonfiction/My-Editing-Process">&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Let the manuscript sit for a few months. Work on something else to help forget all the tiny details. Or have an alpha reader go over it to speed things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Read the entire first draft in 1-2 days, only marking what needs to be changed but not actually changing it. This way bigger problems with the plot and character development will stand out more. Write down major plot points and page numbers on index cards to see if there are long stretches without anything happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Fix everything marked in Step 2, add or subtract parts as needed to fit into the word count goal, but keep the word count at least 5k above what’s needed. Fix saggy parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 4 (optional): If the character’s voice isn’t clear, develop the voice and tweak the dialogue accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 5: Use http://www.hemingwayapp.com/ to find harder to read sentences and complex words. Reduce readability to 3rd grade(at most 4th grade). Anything above it will have too many long and confusing sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 6: Cut or replace as many weaker or red flag words as possible using search and replace (That, just, almost, hardly, nearly, at first, simply, only, actually, basically, clearly, certainly, literally, absolutely, really, so, very, quietly, slowly, quickly, carefully, extremely, suddenly, all of a sudden, see, feel, hear, look, think, touch, wonder, realize, watch, seem, notice, whisper, growl, yell, snap, said.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The disturbance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Call to adventure (the character can be passive here if needed or actively answer the call)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Character states the plan and starts to move the plot rather than follow someone else’s plan (To pursue their love interest, to not fall in love, to get a job, whatever it might be. This isn’t going to be the final goal.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Complications arise and the plan starts to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The promise of the premise (for romance it can be a series of dates.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Midpoint (No turning back. The character realizes he/she is in love. The affair is discovered. Whatever it is, the character can’t go back to the status quo.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New plan(the character has to keep moving the plot instead of being led.) New characters can be introduced as a part of this new plan, but shouldn’t be introduced after this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bad guys close in/self-sabotage/things get complicated&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ticking clock. High stakes. (for example, rushing to the airport after the LI)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Black moment (LI already flew away)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Storming the castle/the final fight to achieve the goal. (characters bring the ending rather than the ending passively happening to them.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Closing image to mirror the opening image. The characters in their new norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t get it out of my head. I’d left the diner five minutes ago and couldn’t get rid of that thought. There were few people out this late and none of them were paying much attention to me, but I couldn’t shake that feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew that taking this late shift was going to bother me. I hated being out late, especially by myself. It was too easy to get mugged in this town and being out during late hours only made it easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept walking, trying not to look too scared. Fear translated into easy prey. I knew that well. I tried to look casual while I clutched my purse and pulled out my phone. That feeling was getting worse and that really bothered me. Sure, I could get scared easily, but I didn’t stay scared. I was the girl that would face her fears all the time just to get rid of them. I don’t like being enslaved to anything, especially fear. If someone could keep you in fear they could control you. I learned that too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I scanned my contacts looking for someone I could call. Emily. That one name made me smile. Emily was one of my best friends. She could talk for hours non-stop about random stuff. Sometimes it was really annoying but other times, like this one, it was a blessing. I dialed her number and pressed the phone to my ear. It rang, and rang, and rang. My frustration meter kept rising higher and higher until I reached her voicemail. Of course, the one moment I want to talk to Emily she won’t answer her phone, how ironic. I returned to my contact list and scrolled through it again. For someone who’s super social, you would think I’d have someone else I could call at one in the morning, but no, I have absolutely no one, perfect. I scowled at my phone and shoved it into my pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Whatever,” I mumbled, “I’m overreacting anyway.” The words were barely past my lips before I glanced up and saw someone staring at me. He was casually leaning against a car fifty feet in front of me with a smirk on his face. I hesitated. He was completely dressed in black with a coat that reminded me of Chuck Norris in the “Walker, Texas Ranger” theme song. His hair was also black, falling to his shoulders in small waves. But it was his eyes that sent chills racing through my body. His eyes were orange, like glow-in-the-dark orange. I stared and his smirk grew wider. I forced myself to think. I was on an empty street, no alleys, no stores to sneak into, and no houses with inhabitants I knew. This was bad, really bad. I contemplated turning around, taking a different road to get home. The only problem was that my house was about two hundred feet past him and he might be here when I came back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guy shifted, positioning his whole body towards me, “Lost, little one?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must be his eyes messing with my head because there is no way he just purred. I swear I heard him purr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Uh, no thank you,” I replied. If I went back and tried to come up another street It would cost me ten more minutes, not even mentioning that he might still be here when I come back around. Well, this was a difficult decision. Either I spend another ten minutes walking up to another street and coming back around or I walk past the two-legged cat with the cloak and hope he doesn’t try to approach me. Typical scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Cloaked Man-Cat chuckled and raised an eye, “You look lost.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at him, “I think I’m on the wrong road.” I murmured before turning around. I had this sudden urge to stop and just walk past him instead, but I ignored it and continued. I reached the next street and turned left not bothering to look behind me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It actually took me closer to fifteen minutes to reach my street again. I kept my eye out for the Man-Cat but to my relief, he was gone. I was safe. Or so I thought. I still had that feeling of fear clinging to my skin. Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lived in a small, two-story house that was a mix of contemporary and oriental. I loved it. It was small and yet spacious with plants decorating the outside and inside. I really liked nature and my home reflected that. I unlocked the door, stepped in, and bolted it back before quickly disarming my security system. I sighed, home sweet home. I allowed myself to breathe and believe I was safe. All I wanted was to take a quick shower and collapse in bed. I walked into my living room and froze. Standing in my living room staring at my bookshelf was him. I gasped and nearly screamed. This couldn’t be real. I’m seeing things. I blinked rapidly but he didn’t disappear. The cloaked cat-man was standing in my living room!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He chuckled and glanced up at me “You know something Kitten, you’re turning out to be very interesting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t move. “How did you get into my house?” I whispered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He slowly smiled at me, “I walked in.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t breathe. He had to be lying. There was no way he just walked into my house. All the doors were locked and my security system was not disarmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s impossible.” I whispered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He chuckled, “For you, yes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He kept looking at me with those eyes and that smirk. I trembled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, no, no. This can’t be happening! I gritted my teeth, “Get out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He blinked and looked surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You know where the door is, use it.” I gritted out, pointing to the door for emphasis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He narrowed his eyes, “Are you sure about that?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Am I sure? Uh, yeah! You’re a complete stranger who broke into my house! What kind of a dumb question is that?!” I snapped back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That irritating smirk returned to his face, “As I said, you’re interesting.” He replied, walking closer to me. “I only know of a few who can resist me like you and they’re either dead or smart enough to stay out of my way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huh? I stiffened as he walked right up to me. There was no way I was moving. I stood my ground and stared him dead on. He was so close I could easily reach out and touch him. I had a sudden urge to do just that but I resisted. Definitely not, never happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He chuckled again, “I’m going to keep you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I blinked. What did he just say? I put on my own smirk, “You’re going to do what now?” I replied. Yup, he was crazy. “Do I look like a pet you can just pick up and take?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He smiled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh crap, he was serious. “Get out before I call the police.” I threatened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Go ahead and try.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did. I really tried to move, but it felt like I was frozen in place. My skin grew cold and my breath turned shallow. It was like I was turning into a frozen statue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’re something Vixen, I’m gonna keep you for a long time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the last thing I heard before I blacked out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bravisha Skietano</name><email>yaolson01@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Someone’s watching me.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/%7B%22teaser%22=%3Enil,%20%22feature%22=%3Enil%7D" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/%7B%22teaser%22=%3Enil,%20%22feature%22=%3Enil%7D" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Chapter 1 ~ Prelude</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/chapter-1-prelude" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Chapter 1 ~ Prelude" /><published>2020-06-26T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-06-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/chapter-1-prelude</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/chapter-1-prelude">&lt;p&gt;Her footsteps, consistent in rhythm, echo in the empty hallway of the university. The pair of three-inch nude stilettos clacking amid the rather quiet afternoon illustrates the confidence of the poised, svelte woman. But it’s all feigned confidence, and no one knows but her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only she can hear the fast pulses in her chest. With every step, her thoughts run amok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is she doing here?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s clear she does not belong in this place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She imagines these are the same thoughts of a young cellist who catches a glimpse of her as he exited the practice room he had booked for two hours but only actually used for half an hour. (Hah! Here’s someone who’s been pracrastinating.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The woman’s pink blazer makes the rest of her attire — a casual fitted white top and denim pants — look regal. Her long, black hair sways in the sides of her shoulders with every stride. Everybody else in the conservatory wears button-down shirts and loose dresses; she’s clearly an outlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the woman stops at the end of a corridor. Room 303. Resting her left cheek on the edge of the closed door, she peeks through the rectangular glass panel. The esteemed maestro, wearing a light blue long-sleeved shirt that folded up to his elbows, is waving his baton at the front and center of the spacious hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was cautious that no one inside the room sees her. The least she wants at that moment is to call attention to herself. &lt;em&gt;She isn’t ready. Not yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heaving, she rests her back on the wall. Inhale. Exhale. One. Inhale. Exhale. Two. The waiting calms her. Inhale. Exhale. Three. There is no need to look through the door again. Inhale. Exhale. Four. Though faint, music from the rehearsing orchestra can be heard from where she stands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realizing how she began slouching, the woman adjusts her posture and composes herself. To a stranger’s eye, she embodies serene self-assurance. Within her, it’s all creeping self-doubt. The woman, already in her 30s yet still looking a decade younger, brings out her phone at about the same time the silence emanated from the practice hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s her cue. She knocks, softly, then waves her hand to call the attention of the conductor. The gentle-looking maestro gestures her to come in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as she enters the large hall, with nary a hum or murmur, her presence commanded the ensemble. All eyes are on her. Perhaps it’s awe and curiosity from these musicians with whom she will be working for the first time — she’s not sure but she may have seen the percussionist wink at her — yet, to her, it feels like surveillance. She hides the unease with a warm smile, as she meekly bows to greet her new colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With his left hand, the maestro points toward the woman in pink, then addresses the big group: “This is Aimee. She’s the soprano I’ve been telling you about. She’s been in this conservatory for only six months, taking the special program, but due to her talent is granted a slot in our midsummer recital.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is real.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The woman reminds herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She can feel her heartbeat rushing; whether it was borne out of excitement or anxiety, she hid it well. She takes an audibly deep breath first, then she looks at the new faces in the crowd, scanning from her and the maestro’s right, moving her gaze toward the concertmaster on her left, like a royalty asserting her place among her subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her mind, however, everything is a blur. What she wanted was reprieve from all the eyes intently looking at her. As she fumbled for words, her right hand finds comfort inside her jacket’s side pocket. No one can see how her pointer finger has begun picking the side of her thumbnail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is she doing here?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s clear she does not belong in this place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hi, everyone,” she takes the plunge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As Maestro mentioned, I’ve enrolled only in the six-month program. I’m not really from here, and I have no plans of being in this profession, so please don’t expect too much from me. I know only a few things about theory. I can’t even read sheet music. I just happen to enjoy singing, that’s why I’m here.” Her velvety voice is music to those who can hear it. She’s singing cheery tunes without even realizing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m an adult beginner who’s never had serious formal training ‘til now. But I will do my best in this performance. And I hope we all enjoy the brief moment we’ll be working together.” She ends with a wide grin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The orchestra consists of musicians from across all ages. While there are a few conservatory students on contract to earn extra income and gain some experiences, most are professionals moonlighting as teachers in their respective instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as she knows, the recital is a big event. It will run for three hours for five consecutive days. Some will perform concertos, and others, like her, will sing opera arias. Such repertoire, with a much-celebrated symphony orchestra, is the most obvious way of showcasing talent. This is the music student’s dream. Not everyone gets a chance at it, but she did. &lt;em&gt;This is real.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For sure, these musicians have been practicing for months. Like she did. They have to be in tune and on time through all the passages of the many pieces they will be performing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her first of two arias is from Purcell’s opera Dido and Aeneas: the somber “Dido’s Lament”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She takes it as a sentimental choice. After all, it was the first opera aria she ever heard. That was six years ago. She tried to study and learn it by ear on her own. Now, she gets to perform the piece that was witness to her growth from a passive appreciator of classical music to a trained soprano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second aria is “Liebestod”, the culminating piece in Wagner’s revolutionary Tristan und Isolde, which finally resolves the curious chord four hours since it is first heard in the opera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As she made the announcement, she can’t help but notice some of her new peers growing wide-eyed. What a contrasting, interesting repertoire. Both fiddling with longing, yes, but one takes flight and the other weighs down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What courage for someone performing on stage for the first time, with less than a year’s worth of training, when all others spend a lifetime trying to perfect their technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The maestro picks up the baton, the woman turns her back against the orchestra, and the musicians await their cues. Within a few beats, the magic comes alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aimee’s singing ebbs and flows like ocean waves, portraying with sound the heartbreaking end of Dido and the bittersweet tragedy of Isolde.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one expects the first pass to be perfect. The soloist and the orchestra are only getting to know each other at this point. But, oh, boy! Time seemed to have stopped in that room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The miracle that is Aimee, a siren that takes away the breath of those who hear her voice, astounded everyone, including the maestro who has already heard her sing before today. Everyone, but the songstress herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She sighs. She nearly ran out of breath in the lingering high notes. In some parts, her throat felt strained. I will have to keep practicing, she reminds herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She turns to face her stunned ensemble, still quiet in awe of her and she doesn’t even notice. Her eyes scans the room for any critique, but what she finds she hadn’t expected to see —&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A violinist about the same age as her with similar almond-shaped Asian eyes. The fringes of his hair almost, but not quite, touching the frame of his thick glasses. Eyes squinting a bit, face forward, as he scribbles on the sheet music with a pencil. His physique, all too familiar. His Ling Ling shirt, a dead giveaway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— it’s Brett.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wonders if he even recognized her.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>cherrythecheery</name></author><summary type="html">Her footsteps, consistent in rhythm, echo in the empty hallway of the university.

Each picture had a single face and a large “X” over it. She pressed a button on her earpiece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Rajar, are you seeing this?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m not sure, what exactly am I seeing?” He replied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All of these people were targeted and eliminated by one of the Blackstones, and it seems like it was Logan.”
&lt;!--more--&gt;
“That’s what I see, I’m just working on the believing part.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zamara felt the same way. Logan Blackstone was a prominent millionaire who rose to first class at the age of sixteen. One-third of his money was inherited from his mother and the rest came from his many businesses. Of the entire family, Zamara expected Vladimir to be their killer, not Logan. &lt;em&gt;And that’s why you don’t assume things.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s no way Logan is our guy.” Rajar remarked, “It’s got to be Vladimir, that guy screams ‘killer.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For all we know they could all be in on it.” Zamara replied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, but only one of them pulled the trigger. You need to get out of there now, return to the party. Whether it’s Logan or not, this guy is dangerous. Get out of there immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Leaving now.” Zamara quickly exited the room and made her way back downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was way too easy to get invited to this party. Hosted by Logan Blackstone himself, this was an “invite-only” engagement, and invites were not cheap. She just “happened” to meet Dorian Blackstone on the street and pretended to be totally oblivious to who he was. Dorian, being used to women falling all over him, was immediately intrigued. It wasn’t every day that someone, a woman no less, completely ignored his existence. Zamara had nearly laughed when he asked for her name. It had been child’s play from there. She feigned ignorance over the first class of America since she was nothing but a young traveler from India who had been born in America but hadn’t been here since she was nine. It was partially true and enough to get a date with Dorian who immediately began to educate her about the wealthy people of America. It wasn’t hard to keep the playboy’s attention. She conveyed beauty, wisdom, mystery, and curiosity quite well. After three days, Dorian invited her to his brother’s yearly gathering so she could meet the prestigious upper class that dominated America. She wondered what he would tell his brother if he discovered that the intriguing Ms. Rose was actually a spy. The thought was amusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rounding another corner, she bumped into another brother, Vladimir. Rajar hadn’t been joking when he said Vladimir screamed ‘killer’. At 6’ 2” with the appearance of a bodyguard, the second child of the Blackstone family looked like he could shoot you in cold blood and sleep like an infant the same night. Zamara wondered if he ever smiled, and if he did would it be with good intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vladimir narrowed his eyes at her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zamara put on a nervous smile, “Excuse me, am I going the right way? I just came from the bathroom and forgot how to get back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vladimir continued to scrutinize her, “This mansion is very big, many people get lost here. Come, let me escort you back to the ballroom.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She smiled, “Thank you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vladimir slowly led her down the hallway. “Tell me, Ms. Rose, how long have you been in the United States?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Only seven months.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I see…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She knew what he was thinking, something like who was she and if her story about the bathroom was correct. It wasn’t a good coverup, but it was true. The bathroom was huge; however, the distance from it to the ballroom wasn’t. The probability of someone getting lost was low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tell me about Dorian,” she asked, “is he really what he seems?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What does he seem like?” He asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She smiled, “Like someone who changes women like one changes clothes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He raised a brow, “Yes, I suppose you could say that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She sighed, “I suppose it’s for the best, he’s not my type anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What would be your type?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Men with secrets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vladimir narrowed his eyes at her, “Secretive men are dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes, but they give you something to figure out.” She replied. “Men like Dorian walk around with all their cards showing, wishing to catch attention from anyone passing by. There would be no surprises and eventually, one would grow bored with them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But at least you would know what to expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I like to expect the unexpected.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tell me, Ms. Rose, in those seven months, how many men have you met?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She raised a brow, “Not many.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I see.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why do you ask?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He ignored the question, “Be careful with the attention you seek, some men will kill to protect their secrets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She smiled mischievously, “And there lies some of the fun, you never know who might kill you and it’s a game to find out as much as you can before the end.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You may end up dead by the end.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Again, surviving is part of the fun.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vladimir stopped and turned to her, “One of these days you will chase the wrong man and he will kill you if not worse.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Than his secrets must have been worth finding.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He smiled and leaned forward, “Too bad you’ll be dead and won’t fully enjoy them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zamara’s heart stopped. Vladimir’s smile was both deadly and beautiful. She knew she was in deep trouble yet that didn’t stop her from leaning forward and whispering, “Who knows, I might survive.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two scared at each other as time slowly passed. Zamara knew she had taken a big risk. The last thing she needed was for the Blackstone’s to be on high alert, especially this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Shall we?” She asked, beckoning to the direction of the ballroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They continued walking. Vladimir didn’t say anything the rest of the way. Zamara wondered what he was thinking. If he really was the Phantom, then his mind would definitely be analyzing their conversation to the smallest detail. Zamara smiled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She had closely examined all of the Blackstones when she had been introduced to them, each had their own secrets. Vladimir was the gun, Logan pulled the trigger, and Dorian was the one that got the gun where it was needed. Yes, the three would make a good team. She wouldn’t be surprised if they shared the same alias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They approached the ballroom, the party still in full effect. Zamara rolled her eyes, she could already pick out the drunk ones. She loved parties but hated alcohol. Dorian had tried to get her to drink some wine and she had blatantly refused, which he took as a dislike for that specific wine instead of wine in general. He had brought back nine different bottles of wine and Zamara had tasted each, none of them were to her liking. That didn’t stop Dorian though, he continued to suggest more types. If she hadn’t chosen to slip away at that point she was sure she would’ve tasted thirty bottles by now and gotten drunk just by tasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zamara turned to her escort, “Thank you for the conversation, I enjoyed it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Likewise,” Vladimir replied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps we can meet sometime.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ah! There you are! I was wondering where you ran off too.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zamara gritted her teeth and turned to the man who was walking across the floor, “I got a bit lost on my way back from the ladies’ room.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dorian smiled as he came to a stop in front of her, “If you would’ve waited for me I could have escorted you and prevented that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t mind, the walk was refreshing,” Zamara replied with a small smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dorian laughed, “One would think you were trying to escape the wine tasting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zamara smiled but said nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dorian turned to his brother, “Can you believe she doesn’t like any of our best wine? I had to start pulling out the cheap stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zamara wondered how “cheap” the cheap stuff was, “I told you not to bother.” she replied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And I told you I would find a bottle of wine you did like.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vladimir glanced at her, “If she does not like the wine, perhaps a scotch would be better.” he suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zamara laughed, “I would prefer neither, thank you. I have an aversion to alcohol, it only gets you in trouble.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vladimir raised a brow while Dorian looked at her like she was insane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You are a most interesting woman,” Dorian remarked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She only smiled, “That’s what I’ve been told.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dorian motioned to where the others were dancing, “Do you wish to dance?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zamara glanced in the direction he was pointing. Couples were twirling around on the floor while the orchestra played a slow waltz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes, I suppose so.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dorian smiled and offered her his hand. She took it and started to follow him, but Vladimir pulled her back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He whispered into her ear, “Those who seek out killers usually get killed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Usually Mr. Blackstone, usually.” She replied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She turned and followed Dorian to the floor. When she glanced back, Vladimir was staring at her with a look that sent shivers down her arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game has begun and in the end, one of them would end up dead.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>bravisha</name></author><summary type="html">Zamara Rose scanned the dozens of pictures lining the wall in front of her.

The scene was the one with the truth-or-dare part. I really liked it and decided to write it down. So, at midnight on May 28, 2020, The &lt;em&gt;Dear Diary, Do You Wanna Hear A Secret?&lt;/em&gt; project was started. It was an absolute joy to write. The words just flowed out of my head and into paper. I have never written chapters so fast. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Sasha wanted to do was finish school, get a job she loved, get married, and start a family. Unfortunately, getting past school seems impossible. Between staying on track with her studies and keeping up with her other activities, graduation couldn’t be farther away. But then the Stone’s show up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caden Stone is… hot. That’s the only way Sasha can describe him without sounding like an idiot. He’s just the guy she should avoid. Which isn’t that hard, even though he watchs her every day and makes her skin crawl. Yeah, avoiding Caden would be a great idea if she wanted to keep her virginity. Too bad Jennifer, Caden’s half-sister, has other plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you wanna know a secret? Because I’ve got a big one and it just may get me in a whole lot of trouble. If it doesn’t kill me first.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bravisha Skietano</name><email>yaolson01@gmail.com</email></author><category term="books" /><category term="Dear-Diary" /><category term="Fiction" /><category term="Novella" /><category term="Romance" /><category term="Comedy" /><summary type="html">Dear Diary, Do You Wanna Hear A Secret? started as a funny scene I created in my head.
