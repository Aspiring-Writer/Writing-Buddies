This site is meant to be a community for writers of all ages to share their work and receive feedback. It would be pretty weird if I never shared with you how to take advantage of that and join the community, right? Well, that's what this article is going to do.

# Behind The Scenes

I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator, to create the site, GitHub Pages to host it, and Siteleaf to edit the content (when I don't want to deal with GitHub :D). This is a completely free way to get a simple site up and running without a lot of hassle. It also appeals to the coder side of me since I can add in my own custom code and design everything myself. I would recommend this setup to anyone who wants to create their website, or blog, for free.

# Accessing the CMS (Siteleaf)

To post content on this site, we use the awesome, free CMS called [Siteleaf.](https://siteleaf.com/) This CMS allows you to post your content in an easy, code-free way.

To access the CMS fill out [this form](/join-us/) if you haven't already and one of the admins will look over your responses, approve them, and email you a link to access Siteleaf.

> **Note:** if you know how to use GitHub or do not mind learning, please create a branch and post your content that way instead. This allows more non-technical users to use the CMS without requiring me to pull out some cash and pay for more users. Thanks.

# How To Use Siteleaf

There are many videos on how to use Siteleaf, so I won't go into detail here. It is very easy to learn and you should have no problem figuring it out on your own, but here are some articles and videos that will help you out:

* [Siteleaf for Clients](https://learn.siteleaf.com/getting-started/siteleaf-for-clients/) (Just an overview of how static sites and Siteleaf work)

* [Siteleaf for Content Managers and Creators](https://www.siteleaf.com/blog/siteleaf-for-content-managers-and-creators/)

* [Publishing A New Blog Post](https://www.siteleaf.com/blog/publishing-a-new-blog-post/)

After reading the articles above, you should have a pretty good idea of what to do to start writing your posts. Most of it is pretty self-explanatory and even your grandparents could probably figure it out. But, just in case you're like me and you like to have the instructions, here's an overview of what you will find once you log into Siteleaf for this site.

## Collections
Once you log into Siteleaf, you should immediately be redirected to the "Pages" collection (more on that below). If you look at the far left of the screen you should see a section that is titled "Content"
![Screenshot_2020-07-30 Add document to Posts.png](/uploads/Screenshot_2020-07-30%20Add%20document%20to%20Posts.png)

These are all the collections in the site, there are currently only 5:
- Pages
- Authors
- Books
- Posts
- Series

You will need to get familiar with what each of these collections contains in order to put the right content in the right place.

Whenever you click on one of these collections, you will be presented with an editor containing a title, content box, tags, categories, date, and any other metadata that goes with that collection. Most of these (like the tags, categories, and date fields) are pretty simple, and I won't go over them too much.

**Warning:** DO NOT include the quotation marks for any of the fields, those are just there to emphasize the field names and what you should enter in.

## Pages
The first page you should land on once you log in is the "Pages" collection. These are just, you know, pages. Chances are you won't be using this collection much.

## Authors
This is the collection containing all the authors on this site. If you post something, anything, you will need to create an author page for yourself. When you click "New author," 
1. Put your name in the title (or your pen name),
2. Write a bio (it can be as long, or short, as you want) in the content box,
3. Upload a picture for your avatar in the "image" box, and 
4. Write a short bio that will appear with your avatar under the posts you write in the "excerpt" field.

That's easy-peasy, right?

## Books
This collection holds all the index pages for the books we're writing. An index page is basically the book's description and the list of chapters, or posts, that go with that book.

When you click on "New book", you will need to:
1. Write the title of your book in the "title" box,
2. Write your book's description in the "content" box,
3. Click the dropdown box in the "author" field and select your name,
4. Upload, or choose, an image for your book's cover (this image should be used as the teaser-image in your following posts, more on that later).

**Note:** If the book is also part of a series of books and you want to include that, add a metadata field called "series" and select the series' name in the dropdown box (more on that below).

## Posts
This is the collection that you will be using the most, it is where all the posts are kept. Simple, right? All the articles, book chapters, short stories, poetry, plays, etc. are kept in this one collection.

This is the one collection where you don't have to fill out all the metadata, some of those fields will be left blank depending on the type of post you are writing and they're just there for convenience. You can just delete the fields you don't use. However, you must fill out the "author", "tags", and "categories" fields.

We already went over what to do with the "author" field, for the "tags" and "categories" field you just put in things to help label your post.

### Tags
Tags can be anything, but I recommend you keep them simple and to the point. For books, they are used as genres as well as any other label you want to associate with the post.

### Categories
This field is **important!** Whatever you put in this field will be reflected in the URL for the post. You should **ONLY** put the type of post and the book/series it is associated with. They should be plural.

- For books: "books" and "your-book-name"
- For posts that are part of a series: "series" and "your-series-name"
- For poetry: "poetry"
- For plays: "plays"
- For articles: "articles"

## Series
This is just like the "Books" collection, it holds the index pages for the site's series. This is mainly for blog posts that are part of a series but can also be used for books that are part of a series. If you are also using it for books that are part of a series, make sure you add a "series" metadata field to that book's index page in the "Books" collection.

## Images
The last thing I want to mention is the images you need for each of your posts. When you create a new post, you have the option to set two images -- a teaser image and a feature image. The teaser image is the image that shows up with your post on the home page and the collection pages. The feature image is the image that shows up as the post's header image.

If you are using an image that doesn't belong to you, i.e. you got one off of [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com), then you will need to credit the author. That's what the fields "credit" and "creditlink" are for, put the author's name in the "credit" field, and the link to the author's page in the "creditlink" field. **DO NOT include https:// in the link.**

**I am planning on creating some videos to show you how to do all of this, stay tuned!**
