## The Purpose

This is a communal blog for aspiring writers of all ages!
Think of it as Wattpad but it's free and your content is **owned by you.**
This site is hosted by GitHub Pages, meaning if you know how to use GitHub you can post (and remove) your own content to this site **for free.**
Of course, there are some rules that you must follow and your content must be approved by the administrators; but, overall **this site is for you.**
So, feel free to write your heart out and share it with others without worrying about who owns your content, because **you do.**

## The Dream

Like all great projects, this site started out as an idea, or dream, if you will.
I wanted a free and fun way to start my own blog, but with so many different options out there it was hard to choose a platform that I liked and trusted.
So many platforms own your data, cost a lot, and lock you into their design(s).
A lot of times they are a hastle to set up.But then, I found Jekyll and GitHub Pages and my dream started to become a reality.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a [static site generator](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one/) that is integrated with GitHub Pages. I came across Jekyll when I was doing my research on the best free blogging platforms.
It appealed to my inner coder side. Everything is created by you and owned by you.
