<p>This is a communal blog for aspiring writers of all ages!
Think of it as Wattpad but itâ€™s free and your content is <strong>owned by you.</strong>
This site is hosted by GitHub Pages, meaning if you know how to use GitHub you can post (and remove) your own content to this site <strong>for free.</strong>
Of course, there are some rules that you must follow and your content must be approved by the administrators; but, overall <strong>this site is for you.</strong>
So, feel free to write your heart out and share it with others without worrying about who owns your content, because <strong>you do.</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-dream">The Dream</h2>

<p>Like all great projects, this site started out as an idea, or dream, if you will.
I wanted a free and fun way to start my own blog, but with so many different options out there it was hard to choose a platform that I liked and trusted.
So many platforms own your data, cost a lot, and lock you into their design(s).
A lot of times they are a hastle to set up.But then, I found Jekyll and GitHub Pages and my dream started to become a reality.</p>

<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is a <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one/">static site generator</a> that is integrated with GitHub Pages. I came across Jekyll when I was doing my research on the best free blogging platforms.
It appealed to my inner coder side. Everything is created by you and owned by you.</p>
