I"8<p>You know that feeling you get when you’ve became one year older?
Or that feeling you get every new year?
That feeling of time passing quicker than you imagined.
The feeling that another year has gone by
And there’s still so much more you want to do.
Time passes so fast,
And life flies by so quickly.</p>
