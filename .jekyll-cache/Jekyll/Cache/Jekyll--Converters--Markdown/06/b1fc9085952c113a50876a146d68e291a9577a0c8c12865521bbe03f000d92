I"»<p>The hour-long rehearsal with the soprano is Brettâ€™s last musician-duty for the day.</p>

<p><em>But do musicians ever stop being musicians when they arenâ€™t playing? Isnâ€™t the mere act of living â€” an accumulation of experiences â€” part of practicing?</em></p>

<p>Brett catches himself overthinking again.</p>

<p>As he keeps his 1952 Scrollavezza violin into its black case, he overhears one percussionist talking to a couple of wind players.</p>

<p>â€œSheâ€™s cute.â€</p>

<p>â€œNah, bro. Sheâ€™s out of your league.â€</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™d take my chance anyway.â€</p>

<p>â€œSo youâ€™re asking her out?â€</p>

<p>If today were like any other day, Brett wouldâ€™ve approached his colleagues to spend the rest of the afternoon with them.
The bespectacled guy, whoâ€™s turning 33 in a few weeks, just loves talking. Uplifting everyoneâ€™s moods is as natural to him as breathing.
Heâ€™s a high-pitched laugh track occupying 170 centimeters of horizontal space.</p>

<p>But today is no ordinary day.</p>

<p>Brett takes his phone out of his pocket to message his best friend, Eddy.
The duo â€” more known for their YouTube moniker TwoSet Violin â€” have known each other for about a third of their lives now
and somehow they still arenâ€™t tired of each otherâ€™s company. Such friendship is a rare treasure. Many envy them.</p>

<p>â€œDUDE!!!!!!!â€ Brett couldnâ€™t have sent a more enthusiastic text message.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s hard to imagine seeing her again. <em>Has she been in Australia all along? Since when? For how long?</em></p>

<p>During rehearsals, since he saw her walk into the room, the violinist tried so hard to avoid eye contact.
If he looked at her, even for a split-second, and their eyes met, he was certain he wouldnâ€™t have been able to focus on his music.</p>

<p>Brett bids his usual jolly goodbye to his friends then hurriedly leaves, making it appear as if he were rushing to make it to another engagement.
That way, no one asks. Itâ€™s a blip in an orchestral musicianâ€™s routine, yes, but itâ€™s still somehow usual.</p>

<p>â€œCâ€™mon, Eddy. Why arenâ€™t you replying!â€ Brett paces down the stairs as his thoughts race. Every five steps or so, he looks at his phone.
Having learned his lesson from a booboo many years ago, back when he was a rookie musician whose phone rang in the middle of a piano part in rehearsals,
Brett has kept his gadgets on permanent silent mode. But this time, he worries heâ€™d miss Eddyâ€™s text, or call, or reply â€” <em>whatever it is,
please, Eddy, make this phone churn a notification.</em></p>

<p>When the two violinists met Aimee five years ago, Eddy pondered on making her an addition to the video channel they formed in 2014 as stressed-out conservatory students,
which has eventually grown into a community of millions of musicians and classical music fans (called Ling Ling wannabes) all over the world.
Aimee, with her background in television work, wouldâ€™ve been an invaluable consultant.</p>

<p>More than Aimeeâ€™s professional insights, however, Eddy valued the new friendship and company.
Not only is she easy to get along with, but Aimee also blends effortlessly with the both of them. The same passion for music.
The inspiring belief that thereâ€™s a bigger purpose in life. The dry humor, though sheâ€™s often at the receiving end of the guysâ€™ jokes.
The nuggets of wisdom that helped motivate them to strive to be better than they were yesterday.</p>

<p>Eddy liked her â€” but five years ago, when she came into their lives, Aimee was on a holiday for only eight days.
The only thing they could do was make the most out of their time with her. Distance is an enemy Eddy wasnâ€™t brave enough to face. Is he any braver now?</p>

<p>Brett canâ€™t help but smile. Having known Eddy since high school, he knows his best friend will be elated by the news, and the suspense is killing him!
Although they rarely spoke about Aimee throughout these years, Brett never really forgot about her and heâ€™s sure his younger friend is the same.</p>

<p>Only five steps away from the exit gate, Brett stops his stirring and looks behind him.</p>

<p>Heading toward him is the same woman occupying his thoughts, still wearing the crisp blazer that singles her out in the sea of summer students.</p>
