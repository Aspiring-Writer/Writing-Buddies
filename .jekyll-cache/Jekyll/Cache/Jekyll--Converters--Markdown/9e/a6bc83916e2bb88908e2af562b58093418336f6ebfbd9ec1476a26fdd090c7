I"×<p><em>Dear Diary, Do You Wanna Hear A Secret?</em> started as a funny scene I created in my head. The scene was the one with the truth-or-dare part. I really liked it and decided to write it down. So, at midnight on May 28, 2020, The <em>Dear Diary, Do You Wanna Hear A Secret?</em> project was started. It was an absolute joy to write. The words just flowed out of my head and into paper. I have never written chapters so fast. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.</p>
