I"Í<p>A violinist and a singer meet again after five years. Despite complications in their personal lives, will their delayed romance finally blend in a harmonious cadence?</p>

<p>Set in 2026 with some flashbacks to 2021, this story uses references from social issues that has happened at the time of writing.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is my first attempt at writing fan fiction â€” or fiction, in general â€” and this work is turning out to be a lengthy, slow burn, one. I shift perspectives throughout the piece as some form of experiment and to also bring voice to the characters.</p>

<p>As I am a newbie in this genre and the fandom, I would greatly appreciate your feedback. Thank you!</p>

<p>Hello! This is my first attempt at writing fan fiction â€” or fiction, in general. I am not a musician, so I may be getting some terminologies wrong, and I will appreciate correction and feedback.</p>

<p>As of this writing (Chapter 1), I am not quite sure yet how the story will go. For sure, there will be Breddy moments, but who ends up with whom is still unclear even to myself. I am of the assumption that this will be a lengthy work.</p>

<p>I just write and wait for the story to reveal itself.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
