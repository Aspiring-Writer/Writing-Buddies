I"c<p>Her footsteps, consistent in rhythm, echo in the empty hallway of the university. The pair of three-inch nude stilettos clacking amid the rather quiet afternoon illustrates the confidence of the poised, svelte woman. But it’s all feigned confidence, and no one knows but her.</p>

<p>Only she can hear the fast pulses in her chest. With every step, her thoughts run amok.</p>

<p><em>What is she doing here?</em></p>

<p><em>It’s clear she does not belong in this place.</em></p>

<p>She imagines these are the same thoughts of a young cellist who catches a glimpse of her as he exited the practice room he had booked for two hours but only actually used for half an hour. (Hah! Here’s someone who’s been pracrastinating.)</p>

<p>The woman’s pink blazer makes the rest of her attire — a casual fitted white top and denim pants — look regal. Her long, black hair sways in the sides of her shoulders with every stride. Everybody else in the conservatory wears button-down shirts and loose dresses; she’s clearly an outlier.</p>

<p>Finally, the woman stops at the end of a corridor. Room 303. Resting her left cheek on the edge of the closed door, she peeks through the rectangular glass panel. The esteemed maestro, wearing a light blue long-sleeved shirt that folded up to his elbows, is waving his baton at the front and center of the spacious hall.</p>

<p>She was cautious that no one inside the room sees her. The least she wants at that moment is to call attention to herself. <em>She isn’t ready. Not yet.</em></p>

<p>Heaving, she rests her back on the wall. Inhale. Exhale. One. Inhale. Exhale. Two. The waiting calms her. Inhale. Exhale. Three. There is no need to look through the door again. Inhale. Exhale. Four. Though faint, music from the rehearsing orchestra can be heard from where she stands.</p>

<p>Realizing how she began slouching, the woman adjusts her posture and composes herself. To a stranger’s eye, she embodies serene self-assurance. Within her, it’s all creeping self-doubt. The woman, already in her 30s yet still looking a decade younger, brings out her phone at about the same time the silence emanated from the practice hall.</p>

<p>That’s her cue. She knocks, softly, then waves her hand to call the attention of the conductor. The gentle-looking maestro gestures her to come in.</p>

<p>As soon as she enters the large hall, with nary a hum or murmur, her presence commanded the ensemble. All eyes are on her. Perhaps it’s awe and curiosity from these musicians with whom she will be working for the first time — she’s not sure but she may have seen the percussionist wink at her — yet, to her, it feels like surveillance. She hides the unease with a warm smile, as she meekly bows to greet her new colleagues.</p>

<p>With his left hand, the maestro points toward the woman in pink, then addresses the big group: “This is Aimee. She’s the soprano I’ve been telling you about. She’s been in this conservatory for only six months, taking the special program, but due to her talent is granted a slot in our midsummer recital.”</p>

<p><em>This is real.</em></p>

<p>The woman reminds herself.</p>

<p>She can feel her heartbeat rushing; whether it was borne out of excitement or anxiety, she hid it well. She takes an audibly deep breath first, then she looks at the new faces in the crowd, scanning from her and the maestro’s right, moving her gaze toward the concertmaster on her left, like a royalty asserting her place among her subjects.</p>

<p>In her mind, however, everything is a blur. What she wanted was reprieve from all the eyes intently looking at her. As she fumbled for words, her right hand finds comfort inside her jacket’s side pocket. No one can see how her pointer finger has begun picking the side of her thumbnail.</p>

<p><em>What is she doing here?</em></p>

<p><em>It’s clear she does not belong in this place.</em></p>

<p>“Hi, everyone,” she takes the plunge.</p>

<p>“As Maestro mentioned, I’ve enrolled only in the six-month program. I’m not really from here, and I have no plans of being in this profession, so please don’t expect too much from me. I know only a few things about theory. I can’t even read sheet music. I just happen to enjoy singing, that’s why I’m here.” Her velvety voice is music to those who can hear it. She’s singing cheery tunes without even realizing it.</p>

<p>“I’m an adult beginner who’s never had serious formal training ‘til now. But I will do my best in this performance. And I hope we all enjoy the brief moment we’ll be working together.” She ends with a wide grin.</p>

<p>The orchestra consists of musicians from across all ages. While there are a few conservatory students on contract to earn extra income and gain some experiences, most are professionals moonlighting as teachers in their respective instruments.</p>

<p>As far as she knows, the recital is a big event. It will run for three hours for five consecutive days. Some will perform concertos, and others, like her, will sing opera arias. Such repertoire, with a much-celebrated symphony orchestra, is the most obvious way of showcasing talent. This is the music student’s dream. Not everyone gets a chance at it, but she did. <em>This is real.</em></p>

<p>For sure, these musicians have been practicing for months. Like she did. They have to be in tune and on time through all the passages of the many pieces they will be performing.</p>

<p>Her first of two arias is from Purcell’s opera Dido and Aeneas: the somber “Dido’s Lament”.</p>

<p>She takes it as a sentimental choice. After all, it was the first opera aria she ever heard. That was six years ago. She tried to study and learn it by ear on her own. Now, she gets to perform the piece that was witness to her growth from a passive appreciator of classical music to a trained soprano.</p>

<p>The second aria is “Liebestod”, the culminating piece in Wagner’s revolutionary Tristan und Isolde, which finally resolves the curious chord four hours since it is first heard in the opera.</p>

<p>As she made the announcement, she can’t help but notice some of her new peers growing wide-eyed. What a contrasting, interesting repertoire. Both fiddling with longing, yes, but one takes flight and the other weighs down.</p>

<p>What courage for someone performing on stage for the first time, with less than a year’s worth of training, when all others spend a lifetime trying to perfect their technique.</p>

<p>The maestro picks up the baton, the woman turns her back against the orchestra, and the musicians await their cues. Within a few beats, the magic comes alive.</p>

<p>Aimee’s singing ebbs and flows like ocean waves, portraying with sound the heartbreaking end of Dido and the bittersweet tragedy of Isolde.</p>

<p>No one expects the first pass to be perfect. The soloist and the orchestra are only getting to know each other at this point. But, oh, boy! Time seemed to have stopped in that room.</p>

<p>The miracle that is Aimee, a siren that takes away the breath of those who hear her voice, astounded everyone, including the maestro who has already heard her sing before today. Everyone, but the songstress herself.</p>

<p>She sighs. She nearly ran out of breath in the lingering high notes. In some parts, her throat felt strained. I will have to keep practicing, she reminds herself.</p>

<p>She turns to face her stunned ensemble, still quiet in awe of her and she doesn’t even notice. Her eyes scans the room for any critique, but what she finds she hadn’t expected to see —</p>

<p>A violinist about the same age as her with similar almond-shaped Asian eyes. The fringes of his hair almost, but not quite, touching the frame of his thick glasses. Eyes squinting a bit, face forward, as he scribbles on the sheet music with a pencil. His physique, all too familiar. His Ling Ling shirt, a dead giveaway.</p>

<p>— it’s Brett.</p>

<p>She wonders if he even recognized her.</p>
