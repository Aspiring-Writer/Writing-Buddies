I'm an eighteen-year-old, homeschooled, Christian student who is struggling to stay motivated and finish things.

I love Jesus, pretty much any yarn crafts (crochet, knitting, macrame, been there done that), reading, writing, horses, developing websites (new at that), FOSS, and anything Linux (I'm not a complete tech geek but I definitely see myself getting there blush).

I'm very social, which isn't a very good thing since I trust people too easily wink, but I'm getting better. I open my mouth a lot before thinking, but as I said, I'm getting better. I procrastinate way too much but prayerfully I will learn some self-control and apply it everywhere in my life (starting with my mouthðŸ˜‹).

PM me if you need help, prayers, encouragement, or just a friend.

I am the guild leader of [Writing Buddies](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/0b3b0faf-41f0-48e7-8e0f-5e2793658041) on the awesome RPG-style to-do list app [Habitica](https://habitica.com). My guild is all about finding someone(s) to help you write that awesome story or blog you've been thinking about. Check it out!
