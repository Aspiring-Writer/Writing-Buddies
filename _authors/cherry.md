Hello! I'm a Capricorn Monkey, INFP-A, and an Enneagram Type Four.

I call myself a recovering workaholic, now advocating for self-love. Self-betterment is a goal I try to pursue every day. My life principles may be mostly ascribed to Buddhism, though I can't say for certain that I'm a practitioner. I've been mostly vegetarian since the last week of October 2018, around the same time I signed up in Habitica.

I'm passionate about journalism and, more recently, rediscovered my fascination with classical music. An old soul who still prefers writing with pen and paper, I keep an online personal journal at [www.cherishmysong.com](www.cherishmysong.com) :)
