I'm an eighteen-year-old, homeschooled, Christian student who is struggling to stay motivated and finish things.

I love Jesus, pretty much any yarn crafts (crochet, knitting, macrame, been there done that), reading, writing, horses, developing websites (new at that), FOSS, and anything Linux (I'm not a complete tech geek but I definitely see myself getting there blush).

I'm very social, which isn't a very good thing since I trust people too easily wink, but I'm getting better.

I open my mouth a lot before thinking, but as I said, I'm getting better.

I procrastinate way too much but prayerfully I will learn some self-control and apply it everywhere in my life (starting with my mouthðŸ˜‹).
