*Dear Diary, Do You Wanna Hear A Secret?* started as a funny scene I created in my head. The scene was the one with the truth-or-dare part. I really liked it and decided to write it down. So, at midnight on May 28, 2020, The *Dear Diary, Do You Wanna Hear A Secret?* project was started. It was an absolute joy to write. The words just flowed out of my head and into paper. I have never written chapters so fast. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

## Description

All Sasha wanted to do was finish school, get a job she loved, get married, and start a family. Unfortunately, getting past school seems impossible. Between staying on track with her studies and keeping up with her other activities, graduation couldn't be farther away. But then the Stone's show up.

Caden Stone is... hot. That's the only way Sasha can describe him without sounding like an idiot. He's just the guy she should avoid. Which isn't that hard, even though he watchs her every day and makes her skin crawl. Yeah, avoiding Caden would be a great idea if she wanted to keep her virginity. Too bad Jennifer, Caden's half-sister, has other plans.

Do you wanna know a secret? Because I've got a big one and it just may get me in a whole lot of trouble. If it doesn't kill me first.
