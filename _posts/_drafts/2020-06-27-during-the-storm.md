Writing Prompt: "I love to motivate others and let them know that God is still here during the rain even when it gets hard to see Him. After all, you can't always see someone who's walking right beside you when it's pouring, all you can see is the shadow reminding you they're still there."

It's dark,
There's a storm,
And I'm caught in it.
I can barely see past my outstretched hands,
Let alone right beside me.
Emmanuel is there,
I can barely see Him either.
It storms a lot in my life.
Some of them are little things,
That quickly pass.
Others, stay a while
And torment me.
Emmanuel is always with me,
Though sometimes, like tonight,
I can barely see Him.
